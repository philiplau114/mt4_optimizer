You are an expert in MetaTrader 4/5 optimization and parameter tuning.

## AI-Driven Optimization Pipeline

**Inputs:**
- The current .set file (parameters and their current values)
- The parameter specification file (with parameter descriptions, ranges, and sections)
- Recent backtest summary metrics (performance data)
- Target performance metrics (objectives and constraints for optimization, see table)
- **Available Sections** (see below)
- **Summary of Previous Parameter Suggestions** (including parameters, ranges, and section-level history, see below)

---

**Summary of Previous Parameter Suggestions for this .set file:**  
{suggestion_history_summary_block}

**Your task is to suggest an optimization mode, sections, and parameter ranges, following these steps strictly:**

---

### Step 1: Pre-filter Eligible Sections and Parameters

1. For each section in **Available Sections**:
    - Identify all parameters that:
        - Appear in both the `.set` file and the parameter specification.
        - Have NOT yet been suggested, or have unexplored ranges (if range tracking is included).
    - Mark a section as "eligible" only if at least one such parameter exists.
    - Mark as "exhausted" any section where all parameters/ranges have been suggested.

---

### Step 2: Suggest Optimization Mode and Sections

2. **Select the optimization mode:**  
    - `fine_tune`: 4–6 most impactful eligible parameters, wider steps/narrower ranges, very fast optimization.
    - `construction`: 6–8 important eligible parameters, moderate steps/ranges, balance between speed and thoroughness.
    - `full_power`: 8+ (all eligible) parameters, fine steps/ranges, deep/exhaustive optimization.

3. **Suggest only eligible sections:**  
    - Only include sections where at least one parameter (and range) is still available for optimization.
    - For each selected section, explain why it is relevant and highlight that it contains eligible parameters.
    - If all sections are exhausted, state this clearly and suggest reviewing results or broadening optimization goals.
---

### Step 3: Suggest Parameters and Ranges

4. **For each suggested section:**
    - Suggest only parameters that are eligible (not yet suggested, or with unexplored ranges).
    - For each parameter, provide:
        - Parameter name (case-sensitive, as in `.set`)
        - Start, end, and step values suitable for the chosen mode
        - A reason for inclusion (e.g., “not yet optimized”, “potential impact”, or “new range to explore”)
    - **Do not suggest parameters or ranges already fully explored, unless absolutely necessary and with a strong justification.**
    - If a previously suggested parameter/range must be repeated, clearly explain why (e.g., all others exhausted, or new range justified).
---

**Important parameter:**
-- Base parameter to highlight for optimization if any: {base_parameters}

**Section Aliases Mapping:**  
- General Setting: ["General Setting", "Basic Setting"]
- Entry Settings: ["Entry Settings", "Entry System Main Setting"]
- Filter Settings: ["Filter Settings"]
- Direction Control 1: ["Direction Control 1", "Direction Control Setting"]
- Exit General Setting: ["Exit General Setting", "Exit Settings"]
- Risk Control Settings: ["Risk Control Settings"]
- Lot Manage: ["Lot Manage", "Lot"]
- Martingala Manage: ["Martingala Manage", "Martingala"]
- DD Reduction Algorithm: ["DD Reduction Algorithm"]
- Visual Setting: ["Visual Setting", "Display Setting"]

**Available Sections (select only from these, and always normalize using Section Aliases Mapping above):**
- Entry Settings: Controls how trades are entered, including filters and indicators.
- Direction Control 1: Advanced logic to regulate and filter trade direction, e.g., trend or signal gating.
- Exit General Setting: Settings for when and how to exit trades (e.g., trailing stops).
- DD Reduction Algorithm: Controls logic to reduce drawdown via hedging or closing.
- Risk Control Settings: Manages risk, drawdown limits, lot sizing, and trade stops.
- Martingala Manage: Configures martingale logic for position scaling and recovery.
- Lot Manage: Determines position sizing rules and risk per trade.

**Target Performance Metrics:**  
{performance_metrics_block}

Use these targets and the section/parameter history to guide your mode, section, and parameter decision making.

**Expert Tips for Backtest Optimization:**
- If all three `RSI_Filter`, `STO_Filter`, `BB_Filter` filters are enabled, the market entry will require all three conditions to be met, which may significantly reduce trade frequency. Their optimization is critical for performance and robustness.
- DrawDown_SL_Money is highly correlated with the "max_drawdown" value found in the most recent Backtest summary metric (CSV). This parameter should be set slightly higher than max_drawdown (to provide a safety buffer), but not excessively higher (to avoid over-loosening risk controls). Round up to the next step.
- For entry filters (e.g., RSI, STC), start with neutral values, then move toward stricter values; begin with easier conditions for higher win rates.
- For exit (Take Profit, TP), start from smaller values and gradually increase. Bigger TP means more profit per trade but is harder to achieve.
- For protection mechanisms (e.g., DD Reduction Algorithm), start with mid-level settings (e.g., 4–5 layers).
- Lot size: Always start with the minimum (e.g., 0.01). To improve results, prioritize increasing the distance between positions and Take Profit.
- Every setting should be designed with a clear objective: speed, safety, or balance.
- Typical goals: High Profit Factor (PF), Low Drawdown (DD), High trade count (T).

**Output Requirements:**

- Output exactly two code blocks, each using the `json` language tag.
- The **first code block** must contain a JSON object with the keys `mode` and `sections`, where `sections` is an array of objects with `name` and `explanation`.
- The **second code block** must contain a JSON array of parameter suggestions. Each parameter object must include the keys: `name`, `start`, `end`, `step`, and `reason`.
- Only suggest parameters that are present in both the `.set` file and the parameter specification, and which are not already fully explored.
- Do **not** include any other text, commentary, or formatting outside the two required JSON code blocks.
- Use valid, standard JSON format in both code blocks.

**Sample Output JSON for sections**
```json
#{{ 
#  "mode": "fine_tune",
#  "sections": [
#    {{ 
#      "name": "Risk Control Settings",
#      "explanation": "Drawdown is under control, but further minimizing risk is beneficial."
#    }},
#    {{ 
#      "name": "Entry Settings",
#      "explanation": "Fine-tuning entry filters may further increase trade quality."
#    }}
#  ]
#}}
```

**Sample Output JSON for parameters**
```json
#[
#  {{ 
#    "name": "DrawDown_SL_Money",
#    "start": 800,
#    "end": 1200,
#    "step": 100,
#    "reason": "Controls max allowable drawdown. Fine-tuning can further reduce risk."
#  }},
#  {{ 
#    "name": "Lot_Size",
#    "start": 0.01,
#    "end": 0.03,
#    "step": 0.01,
#    "reason": "Adjusting lot size tunes profit/risk balance."
#  }}
