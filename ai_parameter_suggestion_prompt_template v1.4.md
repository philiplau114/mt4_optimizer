You are an expert in MetaTrader 4/5 optimization and parameter tuning.

## Optimization Task

**Mode:** {mode}  
- `fine_tune`: Suggest the 4–6 most impactful parameters, with ranges and steps for very fast optimization. Use wider steps and/or narrower ranges.
- `construction`: Suggest 6–8 important parameters, balancing speed and thoroughness. Use moderate step sizes and practical ranges.
- `full_power`: Suggest 8 or more (unlimited if appropriate) parameters for deep or exhaustive optimization. Use finer steps/ranges. No limit on total combinations unless performance is addressed, but always consider computational feasibility.

**Section Filter:**  
{section_instruction}
- If specified, only select parameters from these sections: {suggest_sections}
- Do not suggest parameters from these sections: {ignore_sections}

**Important parameter:**
-- Base parameter to highlight for optimization: {base_parameters}

**Requirements:**  
- Only suggest parameters that exist in the provided .set file.  
- Do not invent or suggest any new parameters that are not present in the .set file.  
- Use only the exact parameter names (case sensitive) as found in the .set file.  
- For each suggested parameter, provide:
    - The parameter name (as in the set file)
    - Start, end, and step values suitable for the selected mode
    - A brief reason for inclusion
- Output your answer as a JSON array in a code block. Each object: {{ name, start, end, step }}

**Current .set file:**

**Parameter specification:**

[Upload PhoenixSpec.csv or paste content here]
```

**Recent Backtest summary metric in csv (for context)**
```

**Target Performance Metrics:**

Use these targets to guide your parameter selection and range recommendations.
**Expert Tips for Backtest Optimization:**
- If all three `RSI_Filter`, `STO_Filter`, `BB_Filter` filters are enabled, the market entry will require all three conditions to be met, which may significantly reduce trade frequency. Their optimization is critical for performance and robustness.
- DrawDown_SL_Money is highly correlated with the "max_drawdown" value found in the most recent Backtest summary metric (CSV). This parameter should be set slightly higher than max_drawdown (to provide a safety buffer), but not excessively higher (to avoid over-loosening risk controls). Currently, the standard approach is to calculate DrawDown_SL_Money by rounding the maximum observed drawdown up to the next step (for example, 100). For example: if max_drawdown is 251 and step is 100, DrawDown_SL_Money should be set to 300. This ensures DrawDown_SL_Money always provides a small buffer above the observed maximum drawdown, while still being tight enough for effective risk management.
- For entry filters (e.g., RSI, STC), start with neutral (center) values, then move toward stricter (edge) values; begin with easier conditions for higher win rates.
- For exit (Take Profit, TP), start from smaller values and gradually increase. Bigger TP means more profit per trade but is harder to achieve.
- For protection mechanisms (e.g., DD Reduction Algorithm), start with mid-level settings (e.g., 4–5 layers). The intervention point (e.g., closing the 1st or 3rd position) greatly affects maximum drawdown.
- Lot size: Always start with the minimum (e.g., 0.01). Larger lots yield faster/more profit but increase risk. Do not rush to increase lot size.
- Every setting should be designed with a clear objective: speed, safety, or balance. There is no absolute right or wrong—only what fits your strategy.
- Typical goals: High Profit Factor (PF), Low Drawdown (DD), High trade count (T).
    - For high PF: Optimize TP.
    - For low DD: Use stricter entry, wider spacing, smaller grids.
    - For more trades: Relax entry, use smaller TP.

**Instructions:**  
- Carefully analyze the .set and spec files.
- Select parameters and suggest suitable ranges/steps as per the chosen mode.
- Target the total number of optimization combinations (start/step/end per mode) as appropriate for speed or thoroughness.
- Output ONLY the JSON code block as described.
